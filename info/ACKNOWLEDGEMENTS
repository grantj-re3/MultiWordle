Word lists

1/ Thanks to Associate Professor Keith Vertanen for making available
   his "Big English Word Lists" at https://www.keithv.com/software/wlist/
   I have used one of these lists for the multi-wordle word list.

2/ Original Wordle word lists were copied from
   https://github.com/Kinkelin/WordleCompetition. In particular:
   - https://github.com/Kinkelin/WordleCompetition/blob/main/data/official/shuffled_real_wordles.txt
   - https://github.com/Kinkelin/WordleCompetition/blob/main/data/official/combined_wordlist.txt

   I have not altered the content but have renamed files to wordsRealWordle_c5_w2315.txt and
   wordsRealWordle_c5_w12972.txt respectively.

   This repository has the Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported licence
   https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/ however I suspect
   that the licence covering these 2 word lists were whatever was
   applicable to the original Wordle repository.

   These 2 files are also available from several other locations on the internet.
